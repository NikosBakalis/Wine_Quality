# Wine Quality

## This is a project based on Suport Vector Machines (SVM)

### First step
```
This code will try to predict the quality of a wine.
Into the winequality-red.csv you can find wines each one with it's own specific characteristics.
One of them is the quality, given by the taster.
This file will be our training-test with analogy 75%-25% to mesure the performance of our model.
After we "train" our code we will try to predict the quality of a wine using Suport Vector Machines (SVM)
and we are going to mesure the performence of the model using f1 score, precision and recall.
```

### Second step
